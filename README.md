# Title: Zomato Dataset Analysis

## Description:

This project involves analyzing the Zomato dataset, which consists of four tables: goldusers_signup, users, sales, and product. 
The goal is to answer 11 questions that provide insights into the dataset's characteristics, user behavior, and sales trends.

## Table Descriptions:

**goldusers_signup**: This table contains information about users who have signed up for the Zomato Gold program.

**users**: This table contains general information about all users, including their userid and signup_date.

**sales**: This table contains information about sales transactions made through Zomato.

**product**: This table contains information about the products sold on Zomato, including their prices and categories.

## Questions:

--- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent on zomato?

--- 2. How many days has each customer visited zomato?

--- 3. What was the first product purchased by each customer?

--- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

--- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

--- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

--- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

--- 8. What is the total orders and amount spent for each member before they become a member?

--- 9. If buying each product generates points for eg. 5rs = 2 zomoto points and each product has different purchase points for eg. for p1 5rs = 1 zomato point, for p2 10rs = 5 zomato points and p3 5rs = 1 zomato point. Calculate points collected by each customer and for which product most points have been given till now?            (2rs = 1 zomato points)

--- 10. If the first one year after a customer joins the gold program (including their join date) irrespective of what the customer has purchased they earn 5 zomato points for every 10rs spent who earned more 1 or 3 and what was their points earnings in their first year ? 
(1 Zomato points = 2RS)  =  (0.5 points = 1rs)

--- 11. Rank all the transactions of the customers
